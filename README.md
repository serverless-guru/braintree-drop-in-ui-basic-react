# Braintree React Basic
This has the most minimal code possible to use Braintree Drop-in UI with React. 

To activate the UI for this, create a Braintree Sandbox account at sandbox.braintreegateway.com.

To generate a tokenization key, used in `src/App.js` inside `dropin.create()`, read https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/authorization/tokenization-key/javascript/v3
